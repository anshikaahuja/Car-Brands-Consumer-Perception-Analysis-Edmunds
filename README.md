## Introduction
Edmunds.com is an online resource for automative information. People post reviews about various cars and use the wesbite for awareness building and research. As an analytics consultant to a (i) brand manager, (ii) product manager and (iii) advertising manager, our job was to give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations on the website
